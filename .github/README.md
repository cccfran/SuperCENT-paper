================
Junhui Cai, Dan Yang, Wu Zhu, Haipeng Shen, Linda Zhao

This file is produced by `SuperCENT_README.Rmd` and includes description
of the replication materials for “Network Regression and Supervised
Centrality Estimation”.

## Folder structure

The folder structure is as follows.

-   **code**: contains code to reproduce the results for simulations and
    case study. The two main files are:

    -   `SuperCENT_simulation.Rmd`: it contains descriptions and codes
        for the simulation results. The corresponding report
        `SuperCENT_simulation.pdf` is generated by
        `SuperCENT_simulation.Rmd` using RMarkdown.
    -   `SuperCENT_case_study_trade_premium.Rmd`: it contains
        descriptions and codes for the case study. The corresponding
        report `SuperCENT_case_study_trade_premium.pdf` is generated by
        `SuperCENT_case_study_trade_premium.Rmd` using RMarkdown.
    -   Details instructions are within the files.

-   **data\_trade\_premium**:

    -   `FX.csv`: risk premium constructed based on Richmond, R. J.
        (2019). “Trade network centrality and currency risk premia.”
        *The Journal of Finance*, 74(3), 1315-1361. See instructions
        [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?doi=10.1111%2Fjofi.12755&file=jofi12755-sup-0001-ReplicationCode.zip).
    -   `real_gdp_long.csv`: GDP data generated using
        `construct_gdp_data.R`.
    -   `trade_data_sub.csv`: bilateral trade data generated by
        `construct_trade_data.R`.

-   **output\_simulation**: contains the simulation results. Please
    download from
    [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8ui7tjtss8teo1x/AACWy8Cf3gALONjCZsoQggUwa?dl=0).

-   **output\_trade\_premium**: contains the results for the case study.

## Installation instructions

In order to replicate the results, one needs to use R and install all
the relevant packages.

### `SuperCENT` package

Install our `SuperCENT` package on github as follows.

``` r
if(!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")
if(!require("SuperCENT")) devtools::install_github("cccfran/SuperCENT")
```

### Other packages

We use `pacman` package to manage packages. Run the following chunk to
install all the packages we will use.

``` r
if (!require("pacman")) install.packages("pacman")
pacman::p_load(data.table, matrixStats, dplyr, ggplot2, igraph,
               latex2exp, tidyverse,
               irlba, xtable, stargazer, circlize, kableExtra,
               ggpubr, grid, gridExtra, gtable, facetscales)
```
